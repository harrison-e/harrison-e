  #### Content Delivery Network (CDN)
  - Implements a DNS server to resolve a hostname to a replica server that is most local to a request
  - Manages an HTTP cache per replica server to minimize time-to-completion for content requests
  
  #### Flight Simulator
  - Simulates the physical properties of an airplane and models it using OpenGL
  - Airplane flies over a procedurally generated landscape
  
  #### Predicting Penalty Kicks
  - Uses MediaPipe and MMAction2 libraries to implement a pose estimation model
  - Predicts the outcome of a penalty kick in soccer using this model
